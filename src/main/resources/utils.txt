error: Encoded password does not look like BCrypt

I was also facing same issue:

In my case table's column length was 50 char only which was causing this issue later I modify column length to 100 as suggested in above and it worked for me.

ALTER TABLE `users`
    CHANGE COLUMN `password` `password` VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL AFTER `enabled`;

This issue is related to column size. As I am using PostgreSQL, it might be of type issue.

Spring Security : Encoded password does not look like BCrypt
Alter the password column type from char to varchar, it solves my problem
